# Rando_LGTM: Bringing Excitement to Code Reviews with Random Approval Words

https://github.com/yossydev/rando_lgtm

## Why I created it

### Increased opportunities for review

Recently, I've had more opportunities to review work, which means I've also had more opportunities to give approval.
When doing so, I've been using external services like [LGTMeow - a LGTM image sharing service for cat lovers](https://lgtmeow.com/) and [LGTM GEN](https://lgtmgen.com/).

However, I've recently found it a bit of a hassle to access the browser and select images every time.

### Return something nice at random!

Lately, I've been writing most of my code using Vim.
If you're developing with Vim, you'll inevitably spend more time staring at the Terminal. That's when I had a revelation from above,
"What if I could just hit a command and it would return a nice word at random...??"
Thank you for the divine message??
I had been wanting to create a CLI tool around that time, so I thought it was a good opportunity to do so.

## Creation

### Narrowing down the features

I often give up on creating things, so I decided to create and release with the minimum features first.
While I was creating it, I came up with various additional features I wanted, but I decided to put them in an [issue](https://github.com/yossydev/rando_lgtm/issues) and postpone them for now.
This allowed me to complete it in about two days, which was great.

### Easy to use

I try to use [brew](https://brew.sh/) for apps and packages as much as possible to make it easy to switch Macs.
When I decided to create it, I wanted to make sure it could be installed with brew, so I did some research.
brew install rando_lgtm
I was able to introduce it in the end.
Furthermore, using GitHub Actions, I was able to update the Brew side version whenever I created a release tag.

## How to use it

- Returns a random word: `rando_lgtm get`
- You can add a word to return: `rando_lgtm add [text]`

Currently, there are only these two commands.

## Future plans

Basically, I'll put any features I want to add in an issue.

At present, I want to implement the following three features

- A feature to view a list of added words: https://github.com/yossydev/rando_lgtm/issues/7
- A feature to reset all added words: https://github.com/yossydev/rando_lgtm/issues/6
- A feature to delete a single added word: https://github.com/yossydev/rando_lgtm/issues/8

I plan to implement these at some point.

## Conclusion

In my second year as an engineer, I was finally able to release my first OSS.
I'm very happy that several people have already starred it since I announced it on Twitter.

Recently, I've been raising issues and leaving comments on OSS, and I feel that my activities are expanding.
I will continue to do my best in the future!!
Thank you for reading to the end!! ‚ù§Ô∏èü´°
